  <h2>Our Goal:</h2>
      <h3>Our goal is to educate people by exploring farther in space.
	  The amount of money we need is about 2-3 trillion dollars
 	  for launches, paying people, rockets, buildings, rocket fuel,
	  contracts, etc. We want to be able to explore more of our solar
	  system as well as other solar systems and galaxies. Also, we're 
	  hoping to have the company done by 2040.</h3>
